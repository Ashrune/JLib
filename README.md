JLib is the main Library used for my plugins. It is advised that you always have the latest version installed, as some of my plugins require newer versions of JLib.
This plugin does nothing on his own, it should only be used in conjunction with one of my plugins.
JLib hooks in Vault and PlaceholderAPI as a soft-dependency. If you want to have all the vault placeholders, make sure you have valid Chat, Economy and Permissions plugins installed.
